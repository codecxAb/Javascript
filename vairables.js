// variables are used to store some data to use it repeated time without asking for it everytime

// three types of variable decleration 1.var 2.let 3.const

var a = "javascript"
let b = 100
const c = [5,6,7]
console.table([a,b,c])

// Note: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.

// Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semicolon (;) â€” your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.
